update_all_repo
===============

A shell script, which can update all git/svn repository in given directory. It's tested in ubuntu 12.10(32-bits). Of course you should install GIT and subversion.

Usage:
  ./update_all.sh [repo path]
  If the repo-path is not given, this script will search git/svn repo in current directory, and update them all.
